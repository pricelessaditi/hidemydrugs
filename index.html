                    <strong>Esmail Corp Website Terms of Use</strong>
<i>Last Updated: July 9, 2019</i>
Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Esmail Corp. (“<strong>Esmail Corp</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”), our website at www.esmailcorp.com, and subdomains of that website (collectively, the “<strong>Site</strong>”). These Terms of Use are a legally binding contract between you and Esmail Corp regarding your use of the Site.
<strong>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY.</strong>
<strong>BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE</strong>, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ESMAIL CORP’S PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THESE “<strong>TERMS</strong>”). If you are not eligible, or do not agree to the Terms, then you do not have our permission to use the SITE. YOUR USE OF THE SITE, AND ESMAIL’S PROVISION OF THE SITE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY ESMAIL AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.
<strong>Arbitration NOTICE. </strong>Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section 15, you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND ESMAIL CORP ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. (See Section 15.)

<strong>1 Esmail Corp Website Overview</strong>. This Site provides information about our production company and its employees and projects, and may provide interactive features that allow you to participate in an augmented reality game (“<strong>ARG</strong>”). All materials on the Site are provided for informational or entertainment purposes only.
<strong>2 Eligibility</strong>. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a)<strong> </strong>you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Site; and (b) your use of the Site is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations.
<strong>3 Use of the Site</strong>

<strong>3.1 Use.</strong> Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Esmail Corp grants you, solely for your personal use, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable permission to access and use the Site during the Term.
<strong>3.2 Restrictions on Use.</strong> Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may not: (a) reproduce, distribute, publicly display, or publicly perform the Site or any Materials (as defined below); (b) make modifications to the Site or any Materials; or (c) interfere with or circumvent any feature of the Site, including any security or access control mechanism.

<strong>3.3 Information You Submit</strong>. Do not submit any information or other materials that you consider confidential or proprietary through the Site. If you choose to provide input and suggestions regarding any potential projects, our company, any of our projects, products or services, or problems with or proposed modifications or improvements to the Site (“<strong>Feedback</strong>”), then you do so on a non-confidential basis (regardless of any designation or indication to the contrary in the submitted information or any accompanying correspondence) and you hereby grant Esmail Corp an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable right to exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, including to improve the Site and create other products and services.

<strong>4 “Employee of the Month” Game.</strong> Certain features of the ARG may designate certain game participants as an “Employee of the Month” or similar, solely for entertainment purposes. Esmail Corp retains the right to select the “Employee of the Month” in its sole discretion.

<strong>4.1 No Employee Relationship</strong>. Use of the term “Employee” or any other similar terms are for entertainment purposes as part of the ARG only and do not create an employee-employer relationship or similar relationship between you and Esmail Corp or any related entity. Nothing in these Terms or on the Site will be construed to create an employment, agency, or service provider (other than Esmail Corp’s limited provision of this Site and related services to you) relationship, partnership, or joint venture between you and Esmail Corp. You acknowledge and agree that Esmail Corp will not provide you any compensation or benefits associated with employment or other similar service provider relationship or any other compensation in exchange for your participation in the ARG. Esmail Corp has full discretion regarding which user is designated as “Employee of the Month” and, once selected, that designation may be removed at any time in Esmail Corp’s sole discretion.

<strong>13 Disclaimers; No Warranties</strong>

THE SITE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. ESMAIL CORP DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SITE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITE, INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. ESMAIL CORP DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SITE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SITE, WILL BE ACCURATE, UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND ESMAIL CORP DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.
NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SITE OR ESMAIL CORP ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE ESMAIL CORP ENTITIES OR THE SITE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SITE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SITE USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SITE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA.
THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Esmail Corp does not disclaim any warranty or other right that Esmail Corp is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.

<strong>15 Dispute Resolution and Arbitration </strong>

<strong>15.1 Generally</strong>. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Esmail Corp in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 15.2, you and Esmail Corp agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND ESMAIL CORP ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
<strong>15.2 Exceptions</strong>. Despite the provisions of Section 15.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
<strong>15.3 Arbitrator</strong>. Any arbitration between you and Esmail Corp will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Esmail Corp. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
<strong>15.4 Notice of Arbitration; Process</strong>. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“<strong>Notice of Arbitration</strong>”). Esmail Corp’s address for Notice is: Esmail Corp, 3900 W. Alameda Avenue, Burbank, CA 91505. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong>Demand</strong>”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Esmail Corp may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Esmail Corp must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Esmail Corp in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Esmail Corp will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.
<strong>15.5 Fees</strong>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Esmail Corp will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing for claims for more than $10,000 will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Los Angeles County, CA, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, the arbitration hearing will not be conducted in-person and you may instead choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator or (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Esmail Corp for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
<strong>15.6 No Class Actions</strong>. YOU AND ESMAIL CORP AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Esmail Corp agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
<strong>15.7 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</strong>. If Esmail Corp makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Esmail Corp’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Esmail Corp’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Esmail Corp will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
<strong>15.8 Enforceability</strong>. If Section 15.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

<strong>16 Miscellaneous</strong>

<strong>16.1 General Terms</strong>. These Terms, together with any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Esmail Corp regarding your use of the Site. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to”. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
<strong>16.2 Governing Law</strong>. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Esmail Corp submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Los Angeles County, CA for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms. We operate the Site from our offices in California, and we make no representation that Materials included in the Site are appropriate or available for use in other locations.

<strong>16.6 Phone Calls &amp; Communications. </strong>If you call a phone number on the Site, the call may be recorded. Esmail Corp does not guarantee that any phone number listed on its Site is toll-free; if you call a phone number that appears on the Site, standard calling rates imposed by your phone carrier may apply. You agree that Esmail Corp and those acting on its behalf may call you at or send text messages to any number you provide to Esmail Corp (including any number that appears on caller ID when you call any Esmail Corp number). You understand and agree that these calls or text messages may include promotional content, and may be placed using an autodialer or prerecorded voice. Your agreement is not a condition of any purchase and you may opt-out at any time by emailing us at hello@esmailcorp.com.

                    As discussed in Section 4 of the Terms of Use, nothing contained in this page, the Site, or the Terms of Use, or otherwise should be construed to create an employment, agency, or service provider (other than Esmail Corp’s limited provision of this Site and related services to you) relationship, partnership, or joint venture between you and Esmail Corp, nor would you be entitled to any compensation or other benefits associated with employment or other similar service provider relationship or any other compensation in exchange for your participation the ARG or the use of the Site.                </span>
